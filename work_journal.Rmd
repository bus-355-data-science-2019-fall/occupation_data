Work Journal

## 2019 10 03
- Topic came up in class about median wage - why only 99k for median wage?  None above 100k?
  Turns out, the data was character type and data type.

## 2019 10 04
- Added data folder
- condensed # of pre-written examples for sorting and filtering (changes can be made as class requests or at teacher's discretion)
